# Vozyvoto

Vozyvoto (voice and vote) is a study of group participation (both in
terms of speaking and being addressed by other speakers) in the
proceedings of government assemblies.

The current demo was put together during the 3rd Hack(at)ONG in
Cordoba, Argentina in September 2016 (see [write-up](Hackatong2016.md)). It analyzes the participation of
female representatives in the congress floor, a topic of interest for
FUNDEPS which (among many other things) studies the impact of
mandatory gender quotas in the Argentinian ballot.
